In 1999, Khan collaborated with Mirza and actress Juhi Chawla to start a production company, Dreamz Unlimited, whose first release was the comedy-drama Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000) starring Khan and Chawla.[9] The film was a commercial failure as was their next production, Aśoka (2001), which led critics to believe that the end of Khan's career was imminent.[10] Khan's career prospects, however, improved in 2002 when Sanjay Leela Bhansali cast him alongside Dixit and Aishwarya Rai as a depressed lover in Devdas, a period romance that garnered Khan critical acclaim.[11] In 2004, he collaborated with his wife Gauri Khan to launch another company, Red Chillies Entertainment, whose first feature was the box office hit Main Hoon Na (2004).[12][13] Khan's popularity continued to increase in the 2000s as he played the romantic lead opposite younger actresses,[14] most notably Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta, in several top-grossing productions, including Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and Veer-Zaara (2004).[15][16][17] He also played against type as a NASA scientist in the drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports film Chak De! India (2007), and an autistic man in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010).[18] From 2007 onwards, Khan began to star opposite a third generation of heroines,[19] most notably opposite Deepika Padukone in Om Shanti Om (2007) and Anushka Sharma in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008).[20] Khan went on to co-star with Padukone in the over ₹3.4 billion (US$51 million) grossing action-comedies Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014), both of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films.[21] </p>
